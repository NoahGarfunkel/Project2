Your goal is to offer constructive suggestions or pose clarifying questions for each project team for each review. \nDeliverables: Students should enter their peer-feedback directly into the Course Team Projects spreadsheet under heading Peer-Reviews I, II, III, etc. Feedback can be as short as one sentence or a paragraph or longer if you have a particular interest in the work.\nPlease end your feedback input with your email address.\nEach student should post comments on at least 3 other projects.\nTo facilitate an even distribution of peer-reviews, please submit comments on those projects listed in close proximity to your own project in the spreadsheet.

Provide some detailed explanation for each of these milestones and deliverables.\nTable 1. Timeline:\nYour group will list all tasks associated with your project (from Task List Assignment #5) and indicate the range of dates (start and completion) that this task will be worked upon. Within the table you should include planned completion dates of all milestones indicated in your Milestones List.\nTable 2. Effort Matrix:\nYour group will produce a table indicating a breakdown of how much effort each group member will apply to each task. You can provide percentage of effort or hours of effort; the goal is to create a table that meaningfully represents your expected division of labor for all tasks. As indicated in your task list, there should be a team member of primary responsibility for each task.\nGood luck and remember office hours are on Zoom on Wednesdays 3-4pm.",
